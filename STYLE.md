This project will follow some style rules and try to be consistent with
the approach and standards used in coding. These rules can change over
time. And beauty makes exceptions worth breaking the rules.

## Documentation
All textual documentation should use `markdown` formating.

EG, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
